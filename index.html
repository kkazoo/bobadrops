                Welcome to the HUMS International Science Bowl Tournament — a fast-paced, bracket-style biology competition for high school students around the world (with a middle school division coming soon!). 
                In teams of 3–4, participants compete in a double-elimination format, racing to answer challenging questions across seven key biology topics: Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Genetics, Plant Biology, Ecology, and Anatomy & Physiology. 
                With a structure inspired by Science Bowl, matches combine the thrill of toss-up speed with collaborative bonus questions. 
                Whether you're here to test your knowledge, represent your school, or connect with fellow science enthusiasts, HUMS ISB is your stage to shine.
